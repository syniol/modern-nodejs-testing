# Modern Node.js Testing
Showcasing node.js native test runner with TypeScript. There is an example test file for a ValueObject `Money`. You can find 
the logic inside `money.ts` and test cases are places at `money.test.ts`. In recent version of Node.js there is a native extension 
to run TypeScript files but in this repository we will be using [TSX package](https://tsx.is) recommended by [Node.js Blog](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/typescript/run). 
This allows us to use TypeScript in node.js versions before `20.x`.


## Up and Running
It's simple to run the test, ensure packages are installed `npm i` and then run the tests with `npm test`.
